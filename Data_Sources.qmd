# The World Bank

The World Bank is a website which is designed to make World Bank data easy to find, download, and use. All of the data found here can be used free of charge with minimal restrictions. All the datasets I am showing right now are coming from this website. This is the link to The World Bank: <https://data.worldbank.org/about/get-started> ![The World Bank](figures/logo.png)

## Life expectancy at birth, total (years)

Life expectancy at birth is the number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same throughout his life. The dataset I am using has more than 250 countries' life expectancy at birth from 1960 to 2020. <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN>

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
life <- read_csv('./data/API_SP.DYN.LE00.IN_DS2_en_csv_v2_4770434.csv', skip=4)
life <- melt(life, na.rm=TRUE, id=c('Country Name','Country Code','Indicator Name','Indicator Code'), variable.name = 'Year')
as.double.factor <- function(x) {as.numeric(levels(x))[x]}
life$Year <- as.double.factor(life$Year)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: fig-life_expectancy
#| fig-cap: Life Expectancy at birth.
#| warning: false
partial_country <- life[life$`Country Name` %in% c('China','Australia', 'India','United States'),]
life_plot <- ggplot(data=partial_country, aes(x=Year,y=value,colour=`Country Name`))+
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Patial Countries' Life Expectancy at birth",
    subtitle = "From 1960-2020",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Ages")+
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Country Name")) 
ggplotly(life_plot)
```

Since the dataset contains more than 250 countries' life expectancy, it is impossible to visualize all the countries' distribution. The plot shows the life expectancy for the Australia, China, India and United States. According to the plot, people can see that the life expectancy are continuously increasing. Compared to the data from 1960, there has been a significant increase in life expectancy in China and India in 2020. Please go to the Data Visualization Tab to see the visualization for all the countries.

## Fertility Rate

The fertility rate is the number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years. This dataset contain most of countris' fertility rate from 1960 to 2020. Same reason as the Life expectancy, the plot only shows the few countries' data. <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?end=2020&start=2020&view=map&year=1974>

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fertility <- read_csv('./data/API_SP.DYN.TFRT.IN_DS2_en_csv_v2_4770506.csv', skip=4)
fertility <- melt(fertility, na.rm=TRUE, id=c('Country Name','Country Code','Indicator Name','Indicator Code'), variable.name = 'Year')
as.double.factor <- function(x) {as.numeric(levels(x))[x]}
fertility$Year <- as.double.factor(fertility$Year)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: fig-Fertility
#| fig-cap: Fertility
#| warning: false
partial_fertility <- fertility[fertility$`Country Name` %in% c('China','Australia', 'India','United States'),]
fertility_plot <- ggplot(data=partial_fertility, aes(x=Year,y=value,colour=`Country Name`))+
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Patial Countries' fertility",
    subtitle = "From 1960-2020",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Rate")+
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Country Name")) 
ggplotly(fertility_plot)
```

## Population

The population dataset contains total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship (midyear estimates). The dataset contains most of countries' population from 1960 to 2020. Same reason as the Life eexpectancy, the plot only shows the few countries' data. <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL>

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
population <- read_csv('./data/API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_4770387.csv',skip=4)
population <- melt(population, na.rm=TRUE, id=c('Country Name','Country Code','Indicator Name','Indicator Code'), variable.name = 'Year')
as.double.factor <- function(x) {as.numeric(levels(x))[x]}
population$Year <- as.double.factor(population$Year)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: fig-population
#| fig-cap: population
#| warning: false
partial_population <- population[population$`Country Name` %in% c('China','Australia', 'India','United States'),]
population_plot <- ggplot(data=partial_population, aes(x=Year,y=value,colour=`Country Name`))+
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Patial Countries' population",
    subtitle = "From 1960-2020",
    x = "Year",
    y = "number")+
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Country Name")) 
ggplotly(population_plot)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
us_daily_birth_1 <- read_csv('./data/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv')
us_daily_birth_2 <- read_csv('./data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv')
us_daily_birth_1 <- us_daily_birth_1[1:2191,]
us_daily_birth <- rbind(us_daily_birth_1, us_daily_birth_2)
us_daily_birth$Date <- as.Date(paste(us_daily_birth$year, us_daily_birth$month, us_daily_birth$date_of_month, sep = "-"))
us_daily_birth <- data_frame(Date=us_daily_birth$Date,Births=us_daily_birth$births)
us_daily_birth_ts <- xts(us_daily_birth$Births, order.by = us_daily_birth$Date)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
ggplot(us_daily_birth, aes(x=Date, y=Births))+
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "US Daily Number of Births",
    subtitle = "From 1994-2014",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of Birth")
```

The plot shows that there is a very clear trend and seasonal pattern in the data.

## Johnson & Johnson
Johnson & Johnson is a well-established and respected company with a strong presence in the baby product market, and its brands like Johnson's Baby are well-known and widely used.
